# Quantitative Finance Learning Journey

Welcome to my repository where I document my learning and contributions to **Perspective** and **Morphir**, two open-source projects under the **FINOS** umbrella. This journey is part of my preparation for the **Google Summer of Code (GSoC)** and my aspiration to become a quantitative researcher with a focus on high-frequency trading (HFT) and algorithmic trading.

## üìö Learning Objectives

- **Perspective**: Enhance skills in real-time data visualization, streaming analytics, and low-latency systems.
- **Morphir**: Deepen understanding of functional programming in finance, focusing on financial contract modeling and risk analytics.

## üóìÔ∏è Timeline


### December 2025
- **Perspective**: Begin contributing to minor issues, such as bug fixes or small features.
- **Morphir**: Start working on enhancing existing models or adding new functionalities.

### January 2026
- **Perspective**: Focus on more complex contributions, including performance optimizations and new feature development.
- **Morphir**: Collaborate with the community on larger tasks and refine existing models.

### February 2026
- **Perspective**: Finalize contributions, ensure all pull requests are merged, and prepare for GSoC proposal submission.
- **Morphir**: Consolidate learnings, document contributions, and engage with mentors for feedback.

## üß† Key Learnings

### Perspective
- **Real-Time Data Handling**: Gained experience in managing and visualizing streaming data efficiently.
